As a result, though, I've always been open to a lot of career paths and have had a lot of trouble figuring out what I want to do. Going into my last year I've done really well in classes (3.95+ GPA), but I never found the subject to be something I was super passionate about: I was more just decently interested. My GPA, in combination with my research experience and volunteer work, has made me at least a viable candidate for law schools, med schools, and Bioengineering graduate programs (probably just a masters), and these three choices are quite different and career-defining.\nMy rationale for considering these programs and not just heading into the work-force is that going to top programs for any of these (especially law and med school) would allow me to rise significantly higher professionally and perhaps find more fulfilling work. A masters in bioengineering would allow me to specialize in the field (the BE field itself has options in which to specialize) more which would definitely improve my job prospects as well.
